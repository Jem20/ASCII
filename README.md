# ASCII Generator (FINALLY UPDATED AFTER A YEAR)
Generates an image into ASCII art.

# Prerequisites
* Install pillow: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
* Install the latest version of python (with PATH specified): https://www.python.org/downloads/

# How to use
* Make a folder anywhere and drag and drop "script.py" and an image.
* Now simply just open the script (VSC is best) and specify the name of the image file and your all done.

Also I recommend to uninstall onedrive as this can break specifiying path files.
